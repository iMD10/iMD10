I’m a **Computer Science student** who enjoys discovering new things and exploring fields that combine **creativity** and **problem-solving**. Currently, I’m diving deeper into **application development** while exploring **AI** and **data analysis**.  

I love learning and building innovative solutions to challenging problems. Whether it’s creating scalable systems or crafting user-friendly applications, I’m always up for a challenge!
